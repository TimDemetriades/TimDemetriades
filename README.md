ðŸŽ“ I'm a recent graduate student where I received my masters in Applied Artificial Intelligence (with a Software Engineering concentration) and an undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. 

ðŸ”­ During my time as an undergrad I was part of the Co-op program where I've had the opportunity to work at a handful of wonderful places including Movado, JobDiva, and SPHERE Technology Solutions in which I got experience in roles such as Software Development, Data Analysis, and Quality Assurance.

âœ¨ During the summer between my undergraduate and graduate degrees I worked as a Data Analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, a financial firm in NYC. There I worked with tools such as Airflow, Python, Docker, and more to create ETL solutions.

ðŸ“¡ As a senior at Stevens I worked on a senior design project - *The Drone Deterrence System*. Myself and a group of 4 other computer and electrical engineering students created a system to detect and deter increasingly prevelant consumer drones.

#### Here's some of my top repositories!

âœ¨ This one is for a graduate course I took at Stevens - *GPU & Multicore Programming*. The course was a great learning experience that went over using CUDA C to parallely run programs on GPUs. Included in the repo are the 4 projects we worked on during the course.

âœ¨ This one is for another graduate course I took at Stevens - *Engineering Programming: Python*. It was another great course that provided me with a strong foundation in Python programming. Included in the repo is the final project for the course in which I created a program to solve the NYTimes Daily Sudoku Puzzle.

ðŸŽ® Finally, here's a project I just recently completed where I created a 2D platformer using Unity (all the sprites were drawn by yours truly). Check it out here on Itch.io: https://iiit1m3diii.itch.io/cloud-nine
