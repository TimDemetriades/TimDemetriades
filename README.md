### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tim, welcome to my GitHub!

ðŸŒ± I'm a recent Computer Engineering Undergraduate at Stevens Institute of Technology where I'm currently obtaining my Masters in Applied Artificial Intelligence. 

ðŸ”­ During my time as an Undergrad I was part of the Co-op program where I've had the opportunity to work at a handful of wonderful places including Movado, JobDiva, and most recently SPHERE Technology Solutions where I have been working since May 2019 as an Implementation Engineer / Software Developer / QA Tester. 

âœ¨ I'm currently working part-time as a Data Analyst at Cantor Fitzgerlad, a financial firm in NYC. There I work with tools such as Airflow, Python, Docker, and more to create ETL solutions.

âš¡ I recently got accepted into the graduate program at Steven's Institute of Technology where I'll be getting my Master of Engineering in Applied Artificial Intelligence with a Software Engineering concentration. I'm part of the Accelerated Master's Program which means I plan on completing my graduate degree by May of 2022 (only 1 extra year).

ðŸ“¡ As a senior at Stevens I worked on a senior design project - *The Drone Deterrence System*. Myself and a group of 4 other computer and electrical engineering students created a system to detect and deter increasingly prevelant consumer drones.

#### Here's some stats! (Thanks to https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats for these awesome graphics)
(As a note, at my current job we use BitBucket instead of GitHub, so this may not accurately reflect what I do at work.)

#### Here's some of my top repositories!

âœ¨ This one is for a graduate course I took at Stevens - *GPU & Multicore Programming*. The course was a great learning experience that went over using CUDA C to parallely run programs on GPUs. Included in the repo are the 4 projects we worked on during the course.

âœ¨ This one is for another graduate course I took at Stevens - *Engineering Programming: Python*. It was another great course that provided me with a strong foundation in Python programming. Included in the repo is the final project for the course in which I created a program to solve the NYTimes Daily Sudoku Puzzle.

ðŸŽ® Finally, here's a project I just recently completed where I created a 2D platformer using Unity (all the sprites were drawn by yours truly). Check it out here on Itch.io: https://iiit1m3diii.itch.io/cloud-nine
